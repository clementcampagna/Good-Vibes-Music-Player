# Good Vibes Music Player

Good Vibes Music Player is a small open-source C# .NET music player.\
\
It uses the Media Foundation API (called through the NAudio library) and is capable of playing all the most common audio formats (mp3, m4a, wav, wma, etc.) and even the main audio track from video files (avi, mov, mp4, 3gp, etc.).\
\
While its interface is pretty intuitive and light, Good Vibes Music Player has all the main features of what makes a music player good: play/pause, track slider (to adjust position in the song while it is playing), volume slider, previous track, next track, play track on repeat, playlist (with ordering and shuffling options), display album artwork, etc.\
